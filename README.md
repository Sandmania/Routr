What's this?
===========
Well it's an Android application for communicating with the Finnish local bus transportation companies via matkahuolto.info. At least it will be when it's done.

Setting up
==========
Well pretty much everything should be provided in the rope it self. You do how ever need ignition-core as an android library project. See [https://github.com/kaeppler/ignition/wiki/Installation-and-setup ](http://)

Using NaviciClient
==================
Routr uses NaviciClient for location and route requests. See client usage information from [https://github.com/Sandmania/NaviciClient](http://)
